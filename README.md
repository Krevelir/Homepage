# Homepage

This is the first page I've ever made â€” it is **a simple page about me**, which I am going to expand as I learn more and more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My plan is to add a section about my favourite books, games, plans and some information about my career.

PS. I do not have a habit of taking pictures of myself; therefore, I used the menacing Gigachad as a placeholder image.
