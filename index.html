                I am a final year student of English Philology at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, with a
                specialization in translation. I love videogames, so I wanted to work with them in whatever year I can.
                After two internships, where I worked with business and legal texts, I decided to start translating
                games. I played a part in translating

                released in 2022, and a few other most recent Microsoft games.
                I do not think I can ever beat these achievements in my career as a translator, so I decided to add
                programming to my list of competences. In
                October 2022, I took a front-end developer course at

                effective and enjoyable experience.

                I got interested in programming years ago, but only recently have I began to approach the matter with
                proper seriousness. I decided to learn the front-end side of projects, as it allows me to use my
                creativity and immediately see the result of my work. In a way, I feel both like <strong>a
                    mechanic</strong> and <strong>an
                    artist</strong>, making sure that everything works and looks the way it is supposed to.
                <br><br>
                &#x1F527 Few activities have captivated my attention as much as fixing issues with my PC, both on the
                hardware
                and software level. I would often forget about the passing of time while following numerous tutorials on
                how to reduce sudden noise coming from my computer, trying different ways to force an uncooperative
                machine to launch, looking for one faulty file that prevents my favorite game from working properly —
                These processes would often take entire days, but I never complained and always found a solution.
                <br><br>
                &#x1F3F0 I've always liked to create things especially castles — sand castles, Minecraft castles, castle
                drawings
                on notebook margins. It is most likely due to my love for historical movies or fantasy worlds like
                <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> or <i>The Elder Scrolls</i>, which have an abundance of fortifications. So,
                why
                is is relevant for a programmer? Well, the best castles need to: <br><br>
                <strong>Be solid</strong> — every segment, no matter if it is made of wood, stone or magical metal,
                needs to be sturdy enoigh to withstand a siege.<br>
                <strong>Be practical</strong> — each element has a strategic value and needs to be accessible to
                defenders and incaccessible to the attackers.<br>
                <strong>Be visually appealing</strong>— a castle needs to look appropriate for its setting, have its own
                atmosphere and take into account wonders of nature, be it a hill or a river.<br>
                <strong>Be meaningful</strong> — real or fictional castles that stay in our memories have one thing in
                common — they carry a story. Great action sequences, triumphant victories or devastating defeats make a
                fortress stand out.
                <br><br>
                The same rules apply to programming. A good product is well-coded, has useful functions, looks appealing
                and helps people get what they are looking for. If a problem-solving activity combined with building
                castles can be a job, then that is exactly the job I want.
